============== NLP Tutorial - Text Representation: TF-IDF =============
What is TF-IDF?
- TF stands for Term Frequency and denotes the ratio of number of times a particular word appeared in a Document to total number of words in the document.

   Term Frequency(TF) = [number of times word appeared / total no of words in a document]

- Term Frequency values ranges between 0 and 1. If a word occurs more number of times, then it's value will be close to 1.

- IDF stands for Inverse Document Frequency and denotes the log of ratio of total number of documents/datapoints in the whole dataset to the number of documents that contains the particular word.

   Inverse Document Frequency(IDF) = [log(Total number of documents / number of documents that contains the word)]

- In IDF, if a word occured in more number of documents and is common across all documents, then it's value will be less and ratio will approaches to 0.

- Finally:

   TF-IDF = Term Frequency(TF) * Inverse Document Frequency(IDF)
